This project has many components. 
	1) A multi-cylce MIPS processor designed from scratch with a CLA (Carry Look-ahead Adder), ALU, etc.
	2) An assembler that converts assembly into machine instructions
	3) Tests
	4) An investigation into matrix multiplication, including:
		a. assembly for an 8x8 matrix multiplication that can be:
			assembled using my assembler
			and run on my processor
		b. code in C++ to demonstrate the efficiency boost using tiled matrix mulitplication as a hardware optimization
		c. code in python to demonstrate the algorithmic speed-up of using Strassen's vs. the naive.
		d. a write up of the results
